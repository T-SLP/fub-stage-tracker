# Correct Architecture Diagnosis

## üèóÔ∏è INTENDED ARCHITECTURE

```
FUB ‚Üí Railway Webhook Server ‚Üí Supabase Database ‚Üí Vercel Dashboard
```

**Components:**
1. **Railway**: Dedicated webhook server (`fub_webhook_server.py`)
2. **Supabase**: Database storage 
3. **Vercel**: Read-only dashboard (NO webhook processing)

## ‚ùå CURRENT PROBLEM

**Vercel has a webhook endpoint it shouldn't have!**

- File: `/dashboard/pages/api/webhook.js` 
- This should NOT exist - webhooks should go to Railway, not Vercel
- This is why Vercel needs FUB API keys (it's doing Railway's job)

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION STEPS

### 1. Verify Railway Deployment Status
- Check if Railway webhook server is actually running
- Verify Railway environment variables are set
- Confirm Railway webhook URL is accessible

### 2. Fix FUB Webhook Registration
- FUB webhooks should point to Railway URL, not Vercel
- Should be something like: `https://your-railway-app.railway.app/webhook`
- NOT: `https://fub-stage-tracker.vercel.app/api/webhook`

### 3. Remove Vercel Webhook Endpoint
- Delete `/dashboard/pages/api/webhook.js` 
- Remove FUB API keys from Vercel (not needed)
- Keep only SUPABASE_DB_URL in Vercel

### 4. Verify Data Flow
- Railway processes webhooks ‚Üí Supabase
- Vercel reads from Supabase only
- No FUB API calls from Vercel

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT

**Vercel becomes purely a dashboard:**
- Only needs database connection
- Real-time updates from Railway webhook processing
- Much cleaner separation of concerns
- No redundant API calls
